            <p>👋</p>
            <p>Hello, and welcome to my corner of the internet. Today, we are taking a deep look into the world of communication technology. Communication technology is a powerful tool that connects people, allowing people to share their lives and moments across the world. But, on the other hand, have you ever thought about what's happening on the other side of the screen?</p>
            <p>Stick with me as we look through two heavyweight topics in our world of technology and information: Privacy and Security and Media Ethics.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Part 1: The Invisible Trade-Off - Privacy and Security in Our Digital Tools</h2>
            <p>We like the ease of use. Free video messaging, text messaging, and storing all our photos in the cloud. However, <em>"If you're not paying for the product, you are the product." Tristan Harris (2020).</em></p>

            <h3>The Potential Harassing Data</h3>
            <p>Every use of a communications tool provides a data trail. This data isn't limited to your communications. This data, in fact, also encompasses your location, your communication friends, your communication duration, your device, and even your typing patterns. These services aggregate all this data. This data can then be used to make a very detailed profile. This detailed profile of you can be sold either to improve your services or manipulate you.</p>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Personal Experience:</strong> When I was chatting with a friend that I needed a pair of running shoes on Instagram. Unfortunately, at this hour, all my postings on a social media site were full of advertisements for sportswear. This absolutely is not a coincidence.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Breaking News of Hacking</h3>
            <p>Our personal information is only as safe as the company holding it. These companies are often hacked, and huge data leaks are very common. A 2023 report found that over 6 billion records were exposed in just the first six months of the year. This means platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook, and Zoom can be vulnerable. Your private messages, contacts, and data could all be exposed.</p>
            <div>
                <h4>Key Statistic</h4>
                <p>A report by Statista states, "The average cost for a data breach worldwide in 2023 was $4.45 million, a 15% increase over three years." This particular statistic is a major concern for corporations but also a direct threat to consumers. A breach is expensive for the company, but it's dangerous for you because your personal information gets stolen.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Location Tracking & Digital Surveillance</h3>
            <p>The majority of messaging apps require that you provide constant access to your location. While this access can be important for features like "Finding friends near you," it creates a live map of your life. This data can be accessed by application developers, which in turn can be hacked by third-party individuals.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>1. Adjust your app permissions</h3>
                <p>In your mobile device, check which apps are using your microphone, camera, contacts, or location. Disable those that you no longer use.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>2. Use Full Conversation Privacy</h3>
                <p>Use messaging apps like Signal or WhatsApp, which offer Full Conversation Privacy. This ensures that you, and you alone, along with your sender, are able to read your messages.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>3. Use Strong, Unique Passwords & 2FA</h3>
                <p>A password manager is your best friend. Two-Factor Authentication needs to be enabled all the time.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>4. Think Before You Share</h3>
                <p>"Consider that your message, email, or post might end up in public." Avoid sharing personal information in a manner that could make it vulnerable.</p>

            <h2>Part 2: The Creator's Dilemma – Ethical Problems in Media Creation and Distribution</h2>
            <p>We are all producers of media now. Every emoji, every TikTok, every Instagram story, every blog post is a choice that involves creativity. With creativity, moral responsibility of unimaginable proportion follows.</p>
            <img src="picture/image1.png" alt="Ethical Issues in Media">
            <h3>Deepfakes, Misinformation, and the Loss of Truth</h3>
            <p>New technology can create fake videos and audio that look and sound completely real, called "deepfakes." This makes it easy to put anyone's face or voice into a picture or video that never happened. As one expert says, the consequences are frightening, from fake political videos to altered evidence. Rep. Adam Schiff (2019) When this is combined with the speed at which false information spreads online, our shared sense of what is real and true will never be veiled.</p>
            <div>
                <h4>Key Statistic</h4>
                <p>A 2016 study by Pew Research Center showed that "64% of U.S. adults say that fake news and information cause a great deal of confusion concerning the fundamental facts of what is happening in the world."</p>
                <img src="picture/image.png" alt="data">
            </div>
            <h3>Digital Piracy</h3>
            <p>"It may be easy to right-click on an artist's graphic and save it, use a song in your video that you know is copyrighted, or share a book in PDF form with a classmate. (Wikipedia, 2015)" These acts of sharing are what we refer to as "theft of intellectual property." Artists are being robbed of their fair share. Musicians, authors, producers of films, software developers; all are being denied their fair share of profit.</p>
            <h3>Personalized Bubble</h3>
            <p>The algorithms that run social media feeds and search engines have one goal, which is to keep you clicking and watching. They learn what you like and then feed you more of it. This might feel helpful, but it creates a bigger problem; you were trapped in your own personalized bubble. You mostly see news, opinions and videos that match your thoughts and views. You're not able to hear other voices. It becomes harder to even understand other perspectives. Also, the algorithm itself can accidentally boost certain voices and quiet others—For example, TikTok, some videos were being boosted for no reason, and some videos even harm others. This shapes our entire online world without us realizing it. The result? Our shared conversations become more divided, and our ability to think critically weakens because we're only seeing part of the world. American news illustrates a poor picture of China, but the reality is different, a truth that many people refuse to admit. The news wants to keep people in a bubble, a truth that many people are hesitant to acknowledge due to prevailing political or cultural biases.</p>
            <h3>The Problem of Cyberbullying and Harassment</h3>
            <p>When people can hide behind a screen, sometimes they say and do things that are truly hurtful. This digital harassment takes many forms: comments, sharing videos, and even sharing someone's private images to humiliate them. The damage from this behaviour is real and severe, it harms people's mental health, reputation, and also their safety.</p>

            <h2>This is Your Ethics Guide</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>1. Check Before Sharing</h3>
                <p>Think twice before sharing that shocking news story or video. Check where it came from. Go to a fact-checking site like Snopes or FactCheck.org. Don't spread disinformation.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>2. Credit Creators</h3>
                <p>Give credit to those who originally created all work. Knowing all the laws about copyrights.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>3. Diversify your feed</h3>
                <p>Make it a point to like and follow accounts of people from different ideologies.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>4. Lead with Empathy</h3>
                <p>Communicate in a way that you would when talking in person. Communicate face to face. Report incidents of bullying and stand out against bullying.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Our communication technology has two sides. It connects us in a convenient environment, but also creates risks of exposing our privacy. The point isn't to stop using these tools, but to use them intentionally and carefully. When we fully understand privacy, we can protect ourselves. When we use the internet ethically, this helps us create an internet that is a more honest, respectful, and creative place.</p>

                <p><strong>"The future of our digital world isn't just shaped by big companies—it's shaped by our own choices."</strong></p>
            </div>
            <p>So let's stay curious, think critically, and always be kind and careful in how we communicate.</p>
