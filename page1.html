        <h2>AI</h2>

1. AI-Driven
What it is:
This trend uses AI tools to digitally extend a photo or video's background, add objects, or create entirely new scenes that weren't originally there. 
No longer need a perfect location or expensive set design. A simple snapshot can be turned into an epic landscape or a sleek studio shot.

A Real-World Example:
A travel photographer takes a portrait in a crowd. Using Generative Fill, they can replace the chaotic background with a clean one.(erase the crowd)
        </p>
        <h2>No AI</h2>
        <p>
2. Without ai
What it is:
This trend does not use ai tools, which means take huge amounts of time to design and no mistake is allowed(otherwise you need to retake one), in-between moments typically found in a personal camera roll.

A Real-World Example:
Instead of a perfectly framed and color-graded "OOTD" photo, a creator might share a photo dump:a screenshot of the song they were listening to.
